            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://ruebot.net/2018/05/thumbnails-in-warclight/">Original post</a>.</p><p>One feature of <a href="http://projectblacklight.org/">Blacklight</a> that I’ve always wanted to setup in <a href="https://github.com/archivesunleashed/warclight/">Warclight</a> is <a href="https://github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight/wiki/Blacklight-configuration#thumbnails-in-results-display">displaying thumbnails in the results display</a>. Getting this setup is a bit tricky. But, since Warclight is <a href="https://news.archivesunleashed.org/warclight-and-walk-providing-a-framework-for-search-and-discovery-of-web-archives-47fbd469da2d">standardizing metadata</a> on <a href="https://github.com/ukwa/webarchive-discovery">webarchive-discovery’s</a> Solr <a href="https://github.com/archivesunleashed/warclight/blob/master/solr/conf/schema.xml">schema.xml</a>, we avail ourselves to a number of fields available for use for a potential implementation. The url field is the obvious choice, but the problem is that Blacklight out of the box will try and display a thumbnail for every url field value you give to config.index.thumbnail_field, leading to a whole lot of missing images on a page.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*78q7Gqw6OjEiDnRepzmFZQ.png" /><figcaption>Broken thumbnails in Warclight</figcaption></figure><p>Well, there’s one image record there out of ten, and a whole lot of broken image links. That’s not useful at all. How can we make it better?</p><p>If we go back to our Solr <a href="https://github.com/archivesunleashed/warclight/blob/master/solr/conf/schema.xml">schema.xml</a>, or checkout the <a href="https://github.com/archivesunleashed/warclight/blob/master/lib/generators/warclight/templates/catalog_controller.rb#L51">catalog_controller.rb</a>, we see that we have a field called content_type_norm. That field uses <a href="https://tika.apache.org/">Apache Tika</a> to <a href="https://github.com/ukwa/webarchive-discovery/blob/4eeb2ac6119ddf2b9e5e9f2b90946e7f69681211/warc-indexer/src/main/java/uk/bl/wa/indexer/WARCIndexer.java#L821-L914">normalize MIME types in ten different buckets</a>. One of those buckets is <em>image</em>. So, if we have a url field value, and we know it’s an image, we could display it as a thumbnail is the results display.</p><p>So, how do we do that? There are a few different approaches. All of which will use the <a href="https://github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight/wiki/Blacklight-configuration#thumbnails-in-results-display">config.index.thumbnail_method</a> option.</p><p><strong>Option 1</strong>:</p><p>A method that returns the value of url if a record is an image.</p><pre>def render_thumbnail(document, options = {})<br>  return unless document.first(:content_type_norm) == &#39;image&#39;<br>  image_tag(document.first(:url), options.merge(alt: document.first(:resourcename)))<br>end</pre><p>The drawback with this option is that it is going to pull in the image from the live web. This may or may not be the image that was originally captured.</p><p><strong>Option 2</strong>:</p><p>Build a replay URL by making use of other Solr fields available to us.</p><p>Using the Internet Archive’s Wayback</p><pre>def render_thumbnail(document, options = {})<br>  return unless document.first(:content_type_norm) == &#39;image&#39;<br>  replay_thumbnail_url = &#39;http://wayback.archive.org/&#39; + document.first(:wayback_date).to_s + &#39;/&#39; + document.first(:url)<br>  image_tag(replay_thumbnail_url, options.merge(alt: document.first(:resourcename)))<br>end</pre><p>Using Archive-It’s Wayback</p><pre>def render_thumbnail(document, options = {})<br>  return unless document.first(:content_type_norm) == &#39;image&#39;<br>  replay_thumbnail_url = &#39;http://wayback.archive-it.org/&#39; + document.first(:collection_id).to_s + &#39;/&#39; + document.first(:wayback_date).to_s + &#39;/&#39; + document.first(:url)<br>  image_tag(replay_thumbnail_url, options.merge(alt: document.first(:resourcename)))<br>end</pre><p>Or your own replay service</p><pre>def render_thumbnail(document, options = {})<br>  return unless document.first(:content_type_norm) == &#39;image&#39;<br>  replay_thumbnail_url = &#39;https://digital.library.yorku.ca/wayback/&#39; + document.first(:wayback_date).to_s + &#39;/&#39; + document.first(:url)<br>  image_tag(replay_thumbnail_url, options.merge(alt: document.first(:resourcename)))<br>end</pre><p>The drawback with these options are that they are using a single replay point. This works well <strong>if</strong> you know every URL in your index <em>should</em> be available for replay from the same replay service.</p><p>This is being used in our <a href="https://news.archivesunleashed.org/warclight-and-walk-providing-a-framework-for-search-and-discovery-of-web-archives-47fbd469da2d">WALK</a> partner instances.</p><p><strong>Option 3</strong>:</p><p>Build a replay url using the <a href="http://timetravel.mementoweb.org/about">Time Travel Service</a>.</p><pre>def render_thumbnail(document, options = {})<br>  return unless document.first(:content_type_norm) == &#39;image&#39;<br>  replay_thumbnail_url = &#39;https://timetravel.mementoweb.org/timegate/&#39; + document.first(:url)<br>  image_tag(replay_thumbnail_url, options.merge(alt: document.first(:resourcename)))<br>end</pre><p>The drawback with this option is that it will just return the most recent <a href="http://www.mementoweb.org/guide/quick-intro/">Memento</a> available. It <em>is</em> a captured version. <em>But</em>, we don’t know know if it <em>is</em> the captured copy we want.</p><p><strong>Option 4</strong>:</p><p>Build a replay using the Time Travel Service API using the wayback_date value.</p><pre>def thumbnail_image(document, options = {})<br>  return unless document.first(:content_type_norm) == &#39;image&#39;<br>  time_travel_base_url = &#39;http://timetravel.mementoweb.org/api/json/&#39;<br>  time_travel_request_url = time_travel_base_url + document.first(:wayback_date).to_s + &#39;/&#39; + document.first(:url).to_s<br>  time_travel_request = URI(time_travel_request_url)<br>  time_travel_response = Net::HTTP.get(time_travel_request)<br>  if time_travel_response.present?<br>    time_travel_response_json = JSON.parse(time_travel_response)<br>    replay_thumbnail_url = time_travel_response_json[&#39;mementos&#39;][&#39;closest&#39;][&#39;uri&#39;][0]<br>    image_tag(replay_thumbnail_url, options.merge(alt: document.first(:resourcename)))<br>  else<br>    return nil<br>  end<br>end</pre><p>The drawback here is that this is going <strong>slow</strong> down page load times. But, it is moving toward a more generalized implementation that covers a use case where you can’t guarantee all the URLs in your index can be replayed on the same replace service.</p><p>This has been implemented on the <a href="http://warclight.archivesunleashed.org/">Warclight demo site</a>.</p><p><strong>Option #5</strong>:</p><p>Implement it at a lower level in the stack, <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/solr/7_0_0//solr-core/org/apache/solr/update/processor/StatelessScriptUpdateProcessorFactory.html">directly in Solr using a conditional copyField</a>.</p><p>Yeah, I didn’t do this 😀.</p><p>The biggest drawbacks here is implementing it requires an entire re-index.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By: Nick Ruest, Ian Milligan, and Samantha Fritz</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*0NHD_0-PVm3DSM1ddTD-bg.png" /></figure><h3>Introduction</h3><p>Since 2015, our research team has been trying to help make Canadian web archives more accessible. While Canadian libraries have accumulated extensive collections over the last decade or more, research interfaces and more crucially, awareness, have lagged. If a researcher say wanted to research “Stephen Harper,” the former Canadian Prime Minister, they’d be <a href="https://archive-it.org/collections/227?q=Stephen+Harper&amp;page=1&amp;show=ArchivedPages">confronted with over 1.2 million results</a>. Our goal was to find different ways to help researchers navigate that sea of data.</p><p>Our first attempt came relatively quickly after launching the project! In late 2015 we provided access to the University of Toronto’s <a href="https://archive-it.org/collections/227">Canadian Political Parties and Political Interest Groups</a> collection at <a href="http://webarchives.ca">webarchives.ca</a>. This led to quite a bit of attention from the general public, appearing on CBC’s <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-november-5-2015-1.3305130/preserving-digital-history-is-imperative-to-save-cultural-history-1.3305263">The Current</a> and <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/radio/spark/293-enhancing-books-wondering-where-the-time-went-and-more-1.3229541/think-a-political-party-has-flip-flopped-now-you-can-prove-it-1.3229550">Spark</a>.</p><p>Building on our success with Toronto’s collection, we wanted to cast our net wider. Could we reach out to several other web archive partners across Canada, many of which had dozens or more of individual collections (many on the same scale as Toronto’s political collection), and provide access to collections? This would complement the existing search portal pages and hopefully highlight the great web archiving that had been going on. We also wanted to provide access to derivative datasets generated by the <a href="http://archivesunleashed.org/aut/">Archives Unleashed Toolkit</a>, such as hyperlink diagrams and full-text datasets.</p><h3>Warclight</h3><p>The first step was to do some outreach. We decided to start with a half-dozen institutions which amongst them collected about roughly half of the web archiving collections in Canada. We began by partnering with the University of Alberta Library for a Compute Canada allocation, and with them, reached out to this initial group of six. These included the University of Alberta, University of Toronto, University of Winnipeg, University of Victoria, Simon Fraser University, and Dalhousie University. Each of them was a subscriber to <a href="https://archive-it.org/">Archive-It</a>, a service provided by the Internet Archive. Our goal was to index their data and provide access to it, similarly to how we provided access to Toronto’s collection.</p><p>Unfortunately, the platform we had used for the first outing was beginning to show its age. Shine was a research prototype, and as such, resources were limited and development work began to slow down. The team discussed with colleagues at the 2016 <a href="http://netpreserve.org/">IIPC</a> conference and decided it would be worthwhile to work on <a href="http://projectblacklight.org/">Project Blacklight</a> implementation of Shine. This would allow us to leverage a long-standing open source community with in-depth knowledge of building GLAM-based search and discovery services.</p><p>Our first foray towards what we now called “Warclight” — a portmanteau of Blacklight and the ISO-standardized Web ARChive file format — was building a standalone Blacklight Rails application. As we began to realize this doesn’t help those who would like to implement it, development pivoted to building a Rails Engine which, “<a href="http://edgeapi.rubyonrails.org/classes/Rails/Engine.html">allows you to wrap a specific <em>Rails</em> application or subset of functionality and share it with other applications or within a larger packaged application</a>.” Put another way, it allows others to use an existing Warclight template to build their own web archive search application.</p><p>We currently have eight Warclight deployments. A <a href="http://warclight.archivesunleashed.org/">demo instance</a>, six instances for each WALK partner, and a federated instance of all the WALK partners. As we progress in the project, we would love to see additional Warclight implementations, and receive feedback as we move towards a 1.0.0 release.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*disZQFUi-tVGT-Cd50HUCw.png" /></figure><h3>How do I get web archives into Solr?</h3><p>The answer here is to again thank UK Web Archive and the <a href="https://github.com/ukwa/webarchive-discovery/graphs/contributors">many others who have contributed</a> (The National Library of Denmark!) for their groundbreaking work with <a href="https://github.com/ukwa/webarchive-discovery">webarchive-discovery</a>.</p><p>Webarchive-discovery allows for a structured approach to indexing ARCs/WARCs in <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Solr</a>, whether that be on a single machine or using a <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop</a> cluster. However, the true hidden beauty of the project is the de facto standardization of metadata fields. Instead of a traditional approach to cataloguing, where each crawl is catalogued with human-generated metadata, we instead can take advantage of all the loosely structured data in a WARC file, and parse it out into a number of <a href="https://github.com/archivesunleashed/warclight/blob/master/solr/conf/schema.xml#L21-L131">searchable fields</a>.</p><p>We’ve created a <a href="https://github.com/archivesunleashed/warclight/wiki/Indexing-WARCs-ARCs-into-Warclight">guide</a> on indexing ARCs/WARCs with webarchive-discovery, as well as completed some <a href="https://news.archivesunleashed.org/a-quick-benchmark-of-webarchive-discovery-e2fccde0b68f">preliminary benchmarking</a> of indexing ARCs/WARCs at our scale. The big lessons learned here are that a lot of resources are required — compute, RAM, and storage — and, at a certain point you will need to pivot from a standalone Solr instance to a <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/7_3/solrcloud.html">SolrCloud</a> instance.</p><h3>What’s next?</h3><p>We’ve just deployed our SolrCloud setup to our new <a href="https://www.computecanada.ca/">Compute Canada</a> resource allocation, and we’re looking forward to feedback from our WALK partners and the larger web archive community on using Warclight as a search and discovery interface for web archive collections. If you have any feedback or would like to contribute, <a href="http://archivesunleashed.org/get-involved/">please don’t hesitate</a>!</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=47fbd469da2d" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://news.archivesunleashed.org/warclight-and-walk-providing-a-framework-for-search-and-discovery-of-web-archives-47fbd469da2d">Warclight and WALK: Providing a Framework for Search and Discovery of Web Archives</a> was originally published in <a href="https://news.archivesunleashed.org">Archives Unleashed</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

We were able to get things setup relatively quickly thanks to a bit of <a href="http://www.francelabs.com/blog/tutorial-deploying-solrcloud-6-on-amazon-ec2/">preparation and practice</a> on our local machines in the previous weeks. Once everything was setup (5 virtual machines total; 4 Solr Cloud nodes and one indexer – details below), we started benchmarking <a href="https://github.com/ukwa/webarchive-discovery">webarchive-discovery</a> and our Solr Cloud setup with <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/">GNU Parallel</a>.¹</p><p>Overall this process took about a day to complete. We selected a relatively small collection from one of our <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/web-archive-group/news/compute-canada-grant-web-archives-longitudinal-knowledge">Web Archives for Longitudinal Knowledge (WALK)</a> partners. Described in detail below, the collection had more WARCs than number of CPU cores on our indexer, and jobs took around 30 minutes to complete. In our tests, we focused on three main areas: varying the number of jobs and RAM, varying RAM and keeping jobs consistent, and running more jobs that CPU cores available. In the future, we would like to do a more rigorous examination. For each run we deleted the Solr index and then started again, and used webarchive-discovery at <a href="https://github.com/ukwa/webarchive-discovery/commit/b36ca7209568f3203db189af777eda4ecb472f6e">this</a> commit.</p><p>The command we ran each time was a variation of the command below, with only --jobs, -Xmx, and the log filename modified each time.</p><pre>$ time find /data/727/4114/warcs -iname &quot;*.gz&quot; -type f | parallel --jobs 16 --gnu &quot;java -Xmx6g -Djava.io.tmpdir=/mnt/tmp -jar /home/ubuntu/warc-indexer.jar -i &#39;Simon Fraser University Library&#39; -n &#39;SFU Affiliated Conferences/Institutes&#39; -u &#39;4114&#39; -s http://192.168.32.20:8983/solr/walk {} &gt; $(basename {})-16-06.log&quot;</pre><p>Below is a summary table of all 19 of the jobs run. Each summary includes the output from time, as well as the number of Solr docs at the end of the run, webarchive-discovery log output from the same file, and the time it took to run on that file. Overall we found that running more jobs than cores available is not only safe, but leads to the fastest results. <strong>As you can see from the chart below, running more jobs than cores available had significant performance advantages over several of the other configurations, and there appears to be a sweet spot at 24–32 jobs with 16 cores.</strong></p><figure><a href="https://public.chartblocks.com/c/59c863879973d20748675a77?t=1cf0304be3dc0e5"><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*nLsChNMu9QvKlbSQ799Ouw.png" /></a></figure><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fairtable.com%2Fembed%2FshrbuXIWAfjbXsuYk&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fairtable.com%2FshrbuXIWAfjbXsuYk&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.airtable.com%2Fimages%2Foembed%2Fairtable.png&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=airtable" width="800" height="533" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/e95e2e35e3556031b7a46da1bd0912a1/href">https://medium.com/media/e95e2e35e3556031b7a46da1bd0912a1/href</a></iframe><p>During this process, it occurred to us that <a href="https://news.archivesunleashed.org/see-a-little-warclight-7b33059355f2">Warclight</a> + webarchive-discovery could be a useful tool for <a href="https://archive-it.org/blog/post/announcing-the-web-archiving-life-cycle-model/">crawl QA</a>. It is relatively painless to fire up a Warclight instance, and index some WARCs with webarchive-discovery.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>by Nick Ruest, Ian Milligan, Jimmy Lin</blockquote><p>What if you have a few terabytes of web archive data setting around, and wanted to shine a little light into them?</p><p>Well, the good news is that now you can! The British Library’s UK Web Archive initiative has created some great software over the last couple years to allow you to <a href="https://github.com/ukwa/webarchive-discovery">index your web archive content</a> into <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Solr</a>, and provide access to it in a discovery interface called <a href="https://github.com/ukwa/shine/">Shine</a>. You can check Shine out in action <a href="https://www.webarchive.org.uk/shine">here</a> (for the British Library’s collections) or <a href="http://webarchives.ca/">here</a> (for our Canadian politics one).</p><p>Starting in 2016, our research team was interested in trying to provide access to Canadian web archival collections. Our W<a href="http://webarchives.ca/about">eb Archives for Longitudinal Knowledge project</a>, or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/web-archive-group/news/compute-canada-grant-web-archives-longitudinal-knowledge">WALK</a>, brings together the web archival holdings of a half-dozen Canadian libraries and aims to provide federated search and access to research derivatives.</p><p>In doing so, we realized that while Shine was powerful, it really lacked an active development community: we wanted to provide access in the same spirit, but on a different platform. But we are also in the same boat as the Shine developers: grant funded, with no real sense that in three, four, or five years down the road that we’d have the time to devote full-time energy to a platform. To keep things going, we would need to leverage a bigger open-source community.</p><p>Enter <a href="https://github.com/archivesunleashed/warclight">Warclight</a>.</p><p><strong>What is Warclight?</strong></p><p><a href="https://github.com/archivesunleashed/warclight">Warclight</a> is a <a href="http://projectblacklight.org/">Project Blacklight</a> based <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html">Rails engine</a> that supports the discovery of web archives held in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_ARChive">WARC and ARC formats</a>. It allows faceted full-text search, record view, and other advanced discovery options. Future work on the project will include integrating the <a href="https://github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight_advanced_search">Blacklight Advanced Search plugin</a>, and creating a new plugin to recreate the existing <a href="http://webarchives.ca/graph?query=recession%2Cdepression&amp;year_start=2005&amp;year_end=2015&amp;action=update">trend search functionality</a> in Shine.</p><p>One of the biggest strengths of Warclight is that it is based on Blacklight. This opens up a mature open source community, which could allow us to go farther if we’re following the old idiom: “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go further, go together.”</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*qunj_cjZlR7rR_RqoPV0Ew.png" /><figcaption>Warclight faceting and search results</figcaption></figure><p>Warclight is designed to work with web archive data that is indexed via the UK Web Archive’s <a href="https://github.com/ukwa/webarchive-discovery">webarchive-discovery</a> project. Warclight currently uses a fork of <a href="https://github.com/web-archive-group/webarchive-discovery/tree/addFields">webarchive-discovery</a> that allows for three additional facets: institution, collection_name, and collection_number. We’ll be working on getting this functionality into core webarchive-discovery so that if you want to take advantage of this functionality you will not need to use our fork of it.</p><p>You can try out Warclight at our <a href="http://warclight.archivesunleashed.org/">demo site</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/archivesunleashed/warclight/wiki/Creating%2C-installing%2C-and-running-your-Warclight-application">you can build your own Rails app</a> and take it for a spin locally.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*io7QnTW423A0K6UJJQyKXg.png" /><figcaption>Warclight item view</figcaption></figure><p>If you’d like to <a href="https://github.com/archivesunleashed/warclight/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">contribute</a> to the project, whether it be feedback, use cases, or code contributions, please do not hesitate! Especially if you have thoughts on what fields should be displayed on an <a href="https://github.com/archivesunleashed/warclight/issues/14">item’s view</a>, <a href="https://github.com/archivesunleashed/warclight/issues/17">search result fields</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/archivesunleashed/warclight/issues/15">facet fields</a>. We also have a channel in the <a href="http://archivesunleashed.org/#involved">Archives Unleashed Slack</a> devoted to Warclight; #warclight.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5_PLZLiRb_FLub0XzTAhNg.png" /><figcaption>Warclight with the Blacklight thumbnail feature enabled</figcaption></figure><p>We can’t wait to work with you all, and bring the rapidly developing Warclight platform to the broader web archiving community!</p><p>Stay tuned for next week, when we talk a bit more about what we’ve been able to do with some of the WALK collections, through interfaces like <a href="https://github.com/archivesunleashed/warclight">Warclight</a> and the <a href="https://news.archivesunleashed.org/the-archives-unleashed-project-warcbase-is-dead-long-live-the-toolkit-724ae171c72c">Archives Unleashed Toolkit</a>.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=7b33059355f2" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://news.archivesunleashed.org/see-a-little-warclight-7b33059355f2">See a Little Warclight</a> was originally published in <a href="https://news.archivesunleashed.org">Archives Unleashed</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Mellon Foundation</a> to make petabytes of historical internet content accessible to scholars and others interested in researching the recent past.</p><p>Since that announcement, we’ve been busy at work at a few different things: modernizing and updating our <a href="http://warcbase.org/">Warcbase</a> web archiving analytics platform, working on a discovery interface and underlying infrastructure, and laying the administrative groundwork for the project itself. We’ll write a bit more next week about the front-end, but for now we wanted to announce the next version of our web archiving toolkit.</p><h3><strong>Warcbase is dead…long live the Archives Unleashed Toolkit</strong></h3><p>We’ve been busy working away on a 1.0 release of the <a href="https://github.com/archivesunleashed/aut">Archives Unleashed Toolkit, or AUT</a>. AUT grows out of the analytics functions of <a href="https://github.com/lintool/warcbase">Warcbase</a>, which has now officially been deprecated. We’ve <a href="https://github.com/archivesunleashed/aut/commit/b72614422a74759cb765ea6db7d3e02b51538988">left behind</a> the Apache HBase and Wayback functionality, focusing instead on the Apache Spark-based open-source platform for analyzing web archives. As we leave HBase behind, Warcbase increasingly didn’t make sense as a name. It really is a toolkit to open up web archives for scholars, hence the “Archives Unleashed Toolkit.”</p><p>If you want to take AUT for a spin, you can download the <a href="https://github.com/archivesunleashed/aut/releases/download/aut-0.9.0/aut-0.9.0-fatjar.jar">0.9.0 release jar,</a> setup Apache Spark locally, and work through the tutorial we have available <a href="http://docs.archivesunleashed.io/">here</a>. If you haven’t setup Apache Spark before, we have a helpful “<a href="http://docs.archivesunleashed.io/Getting-Started/">Getting Started</a>” guide. The jar means that you don’t have to build it yourself!</p><p>What’s the technical roadmap look like for AUT moving forward? The 0.9.0 release was focused on <a href="https://github.com/archivesunleashed/aut/releases/tag/aut-0.9.0">codebase clean-up</a> (<a href="http://java.docs.archivesunleashed.io/">Java docs too</a>!), and getting the project setup on <a href="http://www.sonatype.org/">Sonatype</a>. The next release will be moving the project to <a href="https://spark.apache.org/releases/spark-release-2-0-0.html">Apache Spark 2.0,</a> which will allow us to move to <a href="https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html">Spark SQL and DataFrames</a>. Also on the roadmap is <a href="https://spark.apache.org/docs/0.9.0/python-programming-guide.html">PySpark</a> support.</p><p>If you’re interested in reading about the history of Warcbase and how it was used to explore collections, feel free to check out this article:</p><p>Jimmy Lin, Ian Milligan, Jeremy Wiebe, and Alice Zhou. <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3097570">Warcbase: Scalable Analytics Infrastructure for Exploring Web Archives</a>. <em>ACM Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage</em>, 10(4), Article 22, 2017.</p><h3>Stay Tuned…</h3><p>We’ll be back next week to talk about <a href="https://github.com/archivesunleashed/warclight">Warclight</a>, our <a href="http://projectblacklight.org/">Project Blacklight</a> based discovery interface for web archives.

Little did I know at the time #WomensMarch would be the largest volume collection I have ever seen. By the time I stopped collecting a week later, we’d amassed 14,478,518 unique tweet ids from 3,582,495 unique users, and at one point hit around 1 million tweets in a single hour.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*pcnLXijCAphg7r7B.png" /><figcaption>(<em>Generated with </em><a href="https://twitter.com/pabinkley"><em>Peter Binkley</em></a><em>’s </em><a href="https://github.com/pbinkley/twarc-report/"><em>twarc-report</em></a>)</figcaption></figure><p>This put #WomensMarch well over 1% of the overall Twitter stream, which causes dropped tweets if you’re collecting from the Filter API, so I used the strategy of using the both the Filter and Search APIs for collection. (If you’re curious about learning more about this, check out Kevin Driscoll and Shawn Walker’s “<a href="http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/2171">Big Data, Big Questions | Working Within a Black Box: Transparency in the Collection and Production of Big Twitter Data</a>”, and Jiaul H.

I’ve included the search and filter logs in the <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5683/SP/ZEL1Q6">dataset</a>. If you grep &quot;WARNING&quot; WomensMarch_filter.log or grep &quot;WARNING&quot; WomensMarch_filter.log | wc -l you&#39;ll get a sense of the scale of dropped tweets. For a number of hours on January 22, I was seeing around 1.6 million cumulative dropped tweets!</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/807/0*8kY38p2A1w0iU1Nm.png" /><figcaption>Output of `tail -f WomensMarch_filter.log | grep WARN`</figcaption></figure><p>I collected from around 11AM EST on January 21, 2017 to 11AM EST January 28, 2017 with the Filter API, and did two Search API queries. Final count before deduplication looked like this:</p><pre>$ wc -l WomensMarch_filter.json WomensMarch_search_01.json WomensMarch_search_02.json </pre><pre>7906847 WomensMarch_filter.json <br>1336505 WomensMarch_search_01.json <br>9602777 WomensMarch_search_02.json <br>18846129 total</pre><p>Final stats: <strong>14,478,518</strong> tweets in a <strong>104GB</strong> json file!</p><p>This puts us in the same range as what <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanjgallag">Ryan Gallagher</a> projected in “<a href="https://medium.com/@ryanjgallag/womens-march-e44de05dd001#.5xc7e47rg">A Bird’s-Eye View of #WomensMarch</a>.”</p><p>Below I’ll give a quick overview of the <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5683/SP/ZEL1Q6">dataset</a> using utilities from <a href="http://www.docnow.io/">Documenting the Now</a>’s <a href="http://github.com/docnow/twarc">twarc</a>, and utilities described inline.
