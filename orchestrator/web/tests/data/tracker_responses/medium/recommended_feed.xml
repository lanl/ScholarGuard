            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Web archives, visualized as networks, can provide a number of insights about the makeup of the topic. With the <a href="http://cloud.archivesunleashed.org">Archives Unleashed Cloud</a>, we try to show our users a graph of the link structure that forms from the websites in a web archive, using websites as nodes (dots) and weblinks as edges (links).</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*EiSxV62jc5NgtbuvQO45Dw.png" /><figcaption>University of Victoria’s Trans* Web Archive Link Structure as a Network Graph</figcaption></figure><p>Finding the tools to create a proper network graph has not been as easy as it seems. For one, we would like to give the user some ability to interact with the graphs, especially big ones, so they can dig in a little before deciding to spend their time analyzing the data in more detail using<a href="http://igraph.org/redirect.html"> iGraph</a> or <a href="https://gephi.org/">Gephi</a>. For this reason, <a href="http://sigmajs.org/">SigmaJS</a> has been great, providing instant effects including auto- resizing of nodes, zoom effects and mouse-over access to labels.</p><p>Unfortunately, SigmaJS does not do the required centrality, community detection and layout calculations out of the box. We use <a href="http://igraph.org/redirect.html">iGraph</a> to run these calculations and output them into a GEXF file, that SigmaJS in turn uses to provide attractive first-run visualizations of an entire graph. Without the visualization calculations, SigmaJS simply outputs the data at random, making a network graph that is hard to read. More precisely, we use <a href="https://github.com/archivesunleashed/graphpass">GraphPass</a>, a wrapper for iGraph that I created which runs basic network algorithms on a graph file.</p><p>Unfortunately, once the number of nodes in the graph runs upwards of 50,000, the amount of memory and time it takes to run algorithms like <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep30750">Walktrap modularity</a> or a <a href="https://github.com/gephi/gephi/wiki/Fruchterman-Reingold">Fruchtermann-Rheingold</a> layout algorithm becomes so onerous it can take months to calculate or even blow up a server if the memory runs out. The reason why is pretty simple. In order to do most network graph calculations, you need to build an <em>n x n</em> matrix where <em>n</em> represents the number of nodes. For a graph with <em>n</em> size 50,000, the matrix contains 2.5 billion cells which must be iterated multiple times in order to make the calculations.</p><p>At the end of the day, we want to provide the user with an attractive network output as a starting point for their exploration. We do not want to do the historical work for them, but if they arrive at our service and see a big mess, they will quickly run the other way. Complicating things further, our web archives are continuing — like the World Wide Web itself — to get larger over time. If we want a sustainable service, we need to find a way to display our web archives in a way that both makes sense to the user and does not mislead the user in some unintended manner.</p><p>If we cannot calculate the main visualization elements for large graphs, perhaps we can filter nodes from the graph as a rough representation of the graph using traditional centralization measures. Here are a few candidates:</p><p><strong>Degree measures</strong> : remove websites with the fewest number of links. This could be done using general degree, in-degree (in-links only) or outdegree (out-links).</p><p><strong>Eigenvector measures</strong> : eigenvector measures apply some matrix calculations to consider not only the number of links, but also the links of the websites that link to them. Thus a website linked to by another website with many links would score high. Additional measures like <em>authority</em> and <em>hub</em> conduct similar analysis using in and out ties respectively.</p><p><strong>PageRank</strong> : page rank is similar to eigenvector, but performs its calculations using a random walk across the graph, that is, it simulates someone who “surfs the web” randomly for a period of time and scores each node based on the number of times the surfer reaches them.</p><p><strong>Betweenness</strong> : betweenness uses geodesics or “shortest paths” across the network to calculate influence that comes from sitting between two otherwise disconnected groups. The more geodesics that pass through a website, the higher the betweenness score.</p><p><strong>Randomness</strong> : randomization can help prevent bias when removing nodes from a graph. While randomized filtering is not used in a graph as a whole because, it is used when more nodes have the same centralization score than are required to be removed from the graph.</p><p>Since these measures identify nodes that have a level of influence in a graph (in our case, the likelihood that a website would be read by an average user at the time), it theoretically could be the case that removing the non-influential nodes would have little impact on the visualization of the graph as a whole. <a href="https://github.com/archivesunleashed/graphpass">Unfortunately, as discussed in past posts</a> this turns out not to be the case. Sometimes the non-influential nodes are what make influential websites influential. However, this does not mean we cannot examine what happens when we filter a graph using centralization measures.</p><p>The graph below shows the effect of filtering a graph using various centralization measures on the density of the graph on an archive for the <a href="https://archive-it.org/collections/5840">Edward Snowden</a> controversy. Graph density is calculated by dividing the number of edges in a graph by the total possible edges, which depends on the number of nodes in the graph. The dotted line represents the case where the number of nodes and edges are removed proportionately. For example, when 1% of the nodes are cut from the graph, 1% of edges are cut as well. As might be expected, when nodes are cut from a graph, the density tends to go up because the denominator (the maximum possible number of edges) goes down as nodes are removed. Authority and InDegree scores, however show a slight decrease in density. This suggests that some or many websites with few links are more likely to link to other websites.</p><p>By contrast, filtering by outdegree increases the density of the graph greater than any other centralization measure. This likely means that nodes with low outdegree are less likely to have many links overall. Filtering by degree and PageRank tend to provide results closest to the expected density range.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*7a602RkI2zGWAX9cHnxGBQ.png" /><figcaption>Density Measures for the Snowden Archive</figcaption></figure><p>Since the <em>Snowden archive</em> is only one example, we can show two more. Filtered graphs from <a href="https://archive-it.org/collections/4526"><em>Trans*Web Archive</em></a> from the University of Victoria Web Archives result in a greater increase in density than expected for most values, including indegree. This implies that low-indegree nodes are also likely to contain low outdegree nodes. Again, PageRank and degree filtering produce the results closest to the expected density.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vhi4DlIM2ESUjZqMtIBJdg.png" /><figcaption>Density Measures for the <em>TransWeb Archive</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://archive-it.org/collections/4594"><em>The Anarchist Archive</em></a> results are similar to the <em>Trans*Web</em> results, however, Hub filtered results are also quite close to the expected filtered value. As a rule, it appears that filtering by any method could be influenced by the size of the graph. The smaller <em>Snowden Archive </em>results in filtered graph densities below the expected results, while larger graph densities fall above expected results when they are filtered. Additional studies could explore this as a testable hypothesis.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*M29DiRfvYOFzI3Zz0E9k0g.png" /><figcaption>Density Measures for the Anarchist Archive</figcaption></figure><p>While density is one measure we can test to determine the best way of filtering, there are other ways to diagnose the effect of filtering on a graph.</p><p>One important one is the way rank-ordered nodes are preserved. The way to analyze this is to do the following.</p><ol><li>Identify the rank order of nodes of the original graph. (We use plain degree here.)</li><li>Identify the rank order of nodes after the graph has been filtered.</li><li>Calculate the differences in ranks for each node.</li><li>Apply a t-test for µ=0 for the differences. If the ranks are the same, the probability value for the t-test will be 1.0. If the ranks are drastically different, the value will approach 0.0.</li></ol><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/612/1*_m1WNmooSCw3SrGb9wDuzg.png" /><figcaption>Rank-order distribution of two graphs</figcaption></figure><p>The greater the variance (the bigger the differences) of column C, the more data will be required to confirm that the total difference is 0.</p><p>We can then graph the p-values to see how each method affects the ranking of nodes.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*d_6AOAPvzsYExiJzJL6B8w.png" /><figcaption>Rank-ordering Diagnostics for the Snowden Archive</figcaption></figure><p>Because the filtering process includes some randomness when two or more nodes have the same values, the trend lines are jagged. However, the first observable trait is that most methods of filtering do serious damage to the rank order of nodes in the graph. For the <em>Snowden Archive</em> OutDegree and InDegree values tend to preserve rank order the most while Eigenvector and Betweenness scores offer improved rank comparisons for filtering of nodes beyond about 35 percent.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*M6l6bz5p1uc03f8XG4zVyw.png" /><figcaption>Rank Ordering Diagnostics for the Anarchist Archive</figcaption></figure><p>The <em>Anarchist Archive</em> is somewhat similar. Outdegree (but not indegree) has the best results for preserving rank-order, and eigenvector (but not betweenness).</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*QzXyonrwpQdQTXxil9pW1A.png" /><figcaption>Rank-Ordering Diagnostics for the Trans*Web Archive</figcaption></figure><p>The <em>Trans*Web Archive</em> again shows outdegree as the best for preservation of rank-order. Eigenvector holds some value for 20–35 percent filtered, but becomes less reliable after that. Interestingly, Hub values seem to preserve the rank order as more and more nodes are removed from the graph.</p><p>All of this analysis puts us back into a necessary conundrum. The values that preserve the density of a graph (degree &amp; PageRank) are also the ones that adversely impact the rank order of the nodes (from the perspective of degree). Eigenvector appears to be the best compromise, but there is no clear answer as to when the rank-order of the graph will be impacted.</p><p>As we do not have the benefit of knowing the effect of filtering on very large network graphs, we have no unbiased way of filtering the graph without producing a potentially corrupted facsimile.</p><p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p><p>Applying filtering to large graphs using plain centralization is not feasible if we want to produce fair representations for our users. We have a few options:</p><ul><li>Filter the graph in some other manner, for example, removing all nodes that are not part of a large component. <a href="https://spark.apache.org/graphx/">Apache Spark’s GraphX</a> module can conduct this analysis in parallel, so it’s possible to handle larger graphs.</li><li>Apply more advanced techniques for calculating visualization elements. Stanford’s <a href="http://snap.stanford.edu/">SNAP</a> library for C++ promises to be able to run analyses on very large graphs. However, C++ coding tends to be quite advanced.</li><li>Apply similar analyses using more advanced filtering algorithms that may preserve both node ranking and density better than the given values.</li><li>Conduct analysis on a larger sample of Web Archives to reduce the probability of major impacts from filtering. This option may provide some spin-off benefits, but really is not feasible for our project because we do not want to show misleading representations of our partners’ collections.</li></ul><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=22a998216de1" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://news.archivesunleashed.org/macro-measures-of-filtered-graphs-22a998216de1">Macro measures of filtered graphs</a> was originally published in <a href="https://news.archivesunleashed.org">Archives Unleashed</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By: Samantha Fritz, Ian Milligan, Nick Ruest and Jimmy Lin</p><p><strong>Background</strong></p><p>The Archive Unleashed Project is placed at an intersection of long-term efforts for the web archiving community and earlier initiatives that current team members have been involved with over the past 5 years.</p><p>The project is propelled by the underlying goal of building relatively easy-to-use, transparent tools that are understandable and can help push forward research in history, library/archives, and computer science.</p><p>Enter the Archives Unleashed Toolkit. Circa 2013, the initial infrastructure of the toolkit (for the project then known as <a href="https://github.com/lintool/warcbase">Warcbase</a>) was built using <a href="https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/rdd-programming-guide.html">RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets)</a> because at the time of construction it was the only viable route.</p><p>The AUT team recognizes that future development means understanding the limitations and challenges associated with any framework, as well as planning for upcoming user needs.</p><p>During the most recent Archives Unleashed Datathon, the AUT team engaged with users in a discussion around alternative solutions to RDD that are now available, including PySpark DataFrames, and what this would mean for accessibility, impact, and uptake.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*2oU-T93WPyM-TqaN." /></figure><p><strong>Py</strong> refers to Python, a programming language, which is able to handle complex data analysis and tasks (<a href="https://www.dezyre.com/apache-spark-tutorial/pyspark-tutorial">DeZyre</a>).</p><p><strong>Spark</strong> refers to Apache Spark, which is a distributed computing framework option that helps to process data written in Scala, Java and Python languages.</p><p>Developed by the open source community, <em>“PySpark helps data scientists interface with Resilient Distributed Datasets in Apache Spark (</em><a href="https://www.dezyre.com/apache-spark-tutorial/pyspark-tutorial">DeZyre</a><em>)”.</em> For the web archiving community and the Archives Unleashed Toolkit, PySpark would allow individuals to use the Python language within a Spark framework to produce with a tabular based output. This offers an opportunity for AUT to ensure compatibility, usability, and accessibility with current web archiving practices.</p><p><strong>Community Discussion</strong></p><p>At the Archives Unleashed Toronto Datathon, <a href="https://github.com/lintool">Jimmy Lin</a> presented a short lightning talk on PySpark DataFrames development and facilitated a discussion with participants and community. Community engagement and consultation is important to the AUT project and team and ultimately helps to direct future project priorities and determine development cycles because we want to focus future work on features/items that will be useful and used.</p><p><em>Please see our open </em><a href="https://github.com/archivesunleashed/aut/issues/190"><em>Github thread</em></a><em> for a full record of RDD to PySpark DataFrames discussions, or to provide feedback.</em></p><p>The question posed during the community discussion was: should we treat AUT like a big SQL? Meaning a departure from RDDs toward DataFrames.</p><p>There was a general consensus that a data frames infrastructure made sense because of the familiarity with Python by users and their support teams, as well as makes visually reading data outputs much easier. Another benefit to PySpark DataFrames is the ability for users to roll over into the rest of the Python ecosystem, such as the <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> library. Rather than our team having to roll all of our own functions and libraries (not to mention documenting them in the relatively unfamiliar Scala language), users can just pipe outputs into the Python commands they feel most comfortable using!</p><p><strong>Implementation</strong></p><p>The enthusiasm for a PySpark DataFrames framework prompted a productive and inspired #HackArchives moment for Jimmy. By Friday afternoon there was a working demo of PySpark DataFrames on an AUT branch!</p><style>body[data-twttr-rendered="true"] {background-color: transparent;}.twitter-tweet {margin: auto !important;}</style><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-align="center" data-dnt="true"><p>On a late train into Toronto to attend the Canadian Data Science Workshop tomorrow!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By: Samantha Fritz, Ian Milligan, Ryan Deschamps, Nick Ruest, Jimmy Lin</p><p>April 2018 was a busy month for the Archives Unleashed Team and community, including the latest <a href="https://github.com/archivesunleashed/aut/releases/tag/aut-0.16.0">AUT 0.16.0 release</a>. The toolkit has seen quite a bit of development and testing since the beginning of the year, so let’s take a closer look into what’s been done and the individuals who’ve helped to make it happen.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*jo_jAAwHNlmromOrn7w01Q.png" /><figcaption>Archives Unleashed Toolkit Commit Activity</figcaption></figure><p><strong>What’s New with AUT?</strong></p><p>With contributions from <a href="https://github.com/ruebot">Nick Ruest</a>, <a href="https://github.com/lintool">Jimmy Lin</a>, <a href="https://github.com/greebie">Ryan Deschamps</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ianmilligan1">Ian Milligan</a>, <a href="https://github.com/helgeho">Helge Holzmann</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cjer">Dan Bareket</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/dportabella">David Portabella</a> AUT has been through four release cycles since January 2018.</p><p><em>For a comprehensive list of all work done, please see the </em><a href="https://github.com/archivesunleashed/aut/tags"><em>AUT release notes</em></a><em>.</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fNKVEZyBk2WfRxoXKcC-hQ.png" /><figcaption>Archives Unleashed Toolkit Release Summary</figcaption></figure><p>There have been six areas of focus over these releases, which include:</p><ol><li>PySpark &amp; Data Frames</li><li>Code Refactoring &amp; Tweet Analysis</li><li>GraphML/GEXF network analysis work</li><li>Scala Docs</li><li>Dates and Pages</li><li>Memory Management</li></ol><p><strong>PySpark &amp; Data Frames</strong></p><p>During the Archives Unleashed Datathon, co-investigator <a href="https://github.com/lintool">Jimmy Lin</a> led a <a href="https://github.com/archivesunleashed/aut/issues/190#issuecomment-384777298">discussion on the of AUT support of PySpark DataFrames</a>. With consensus from users, some coffee, and a minor scare to undo a Git mishap, by Friday afternoon there was working code on a branch demonstrating PySpark and DataFrame integration! Feel free to jump in on the conversation about PySpark in our <a href="https://github.com/archivesunleashed/aut/issues/190">open github thread.</a></p><p><strong>Code Refactoring &amp; Tweet Analysis</strong></p><p>In addition to a discussion of data frames, work at the datathon helped to produce two major pull requests that dealt with code refactoring and patching the tweet analysis functionality.</p><p>The aim of refactoring is to improve the design of a codebase without affecting its functionality. The process involves restructuring to improve readability and reduce complexity. Jimmy completed a refactoring of the AUT codebase so that class and import structures were simplified and rationalized. This included the clean up of import structures to remove unnecessary classes, as well as restructure naming conventions and class hierarchy.</p><p>During an afternoon of collaboration, AUT project members Jimmy Lin and Nick Ruest were able to correct the Twitter analysis functionality by upgrading dependencies.</p><p><strong>GraphML/GEXF</strong></p><p>The Archives Unleashed Toolkit supports a users ability to export data directly to the <a href="https://gephi.org/">Gephi software suite</a> by writing to the GEXF format. GraphML and GEXF were selected to be output formats in AUT because they are supported by a majority of visualization and network analysis tools including Gephi, iGraph, NetworkX, Neo4j, UCINET and Sigma js. Both formats are human readable XML, so they can be manipulated using a text editor if desired. Once imported into these tools, there is no end to the kinds of analysis and visualisations that can be done on the Web Archives.</p><p>There were several enhancements, fixed bugs and pull requests that related directly to GraphML improvements. For instance, we discovered some GEXF outputs were breaking on a few of our larger collections. Thanks to user feedback and collaboration with community member <a href="https://github.com/cjer">Dan Bareket,</a> we were able to troubleshoot the issue and the bug has been fixed.</p><p>The AUT team continuing to work in the area as we move towards a 0.17.0 release and look towards maximizing the the benefits of Apache Spark and GraphX.</p><p><strong>Scala Docs</strong></p><p>We know how important documentation is! Ryan and Nick spent time improving and updating our Scala documentation. You can check out the Scala Docs at <a href="http://java.docs.archivesunleashed.io/0.16.0/scaladocs/index.html#package">here</a>. This will help more people use our toolkit, and more importantly, contribute to it if they want to.</p><p><strong>Dates and Pages</strong></p><p>There are a number of scripts users can use in AUT to run analysis on web archive collections. Each script combines several commands, which in turn produces results filtered by various elements such as domains and date ranges.</p><p>In the most recent releases, there has been a focus on two functions (or for our technical readers, “methods”): .keepValidPages() and.KeepDate().</p><p>The purpose of <strong>.keepValidPages</strong>() is to remove anything that is not html or xml, or that somehow failed to generate a date when it was crawled. In line with the “filter” section of our FAAV cycle, this function keeps AUT from having to run analysis on things that are not important for research, which saves on computing time. Our code refactoring also fixed some minor bugs associated with .keepValidPages().</p><p>We also had use cases where people may have wanted to have information from multiple crawls — say, content containing the word “pipeline” in 2012 <em>and </em>2017. Previously this would have required two separate jobs! We changed our <strong>.keepDate</strong>() function to allow the input of a list, so that you can provide multiple years, months, or even days that you are interested in.</p><p><strong>Memory Management</strong></p><p>There were two instances of memory management issues, one within a Java Runtime (<a href="https://github.com/archivesunleashed/aut/issues/159">Issue #159</a>), while the other occurred when using AUT to extract text from a WARC (<a href="https://github.com/archivesunleashed/aut/issues/158">Issue #158</a>). Through several trials, Ian Milligan found that limiting the number of cores, in the case reducing it to 12, helped to solve the Java Runtime error.</p><p>Ian also explored the similarities of errors occurring when running text extractions on WARC files and found that if he ran derivative generation independently the error was solved. As AUT moves forward, our team will look to documenting some best practices to assist users in production environments.</p><p><strong>Acknowledgments</strong></p><p>The latests releases of AUT would not have been possible without some amazing individuals!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether working with social media, web archives or email server data, it becomes necessary at some point to narrow the amount of data . For instance, if we are interested in environmental policy, removing tweets or websites about football games, television shows or music makes sense. If we want to conduct a history of activism in the 1990s, we certainly could exclude data from the 2000s and might only include data from the 1980s to provide historical context.</p><p>Combing through email and social media data manually could take an army of thousands many years depending on how much attention it received. Sometimes we rely on messy search algorithms for data, and then (perhaps) conduct a visualisation using social network analysis to show where the influencers lie.</p><p>The good news is that great tools exist to do this. For example, <a href="http://www.gephi.org">Gephi</a> is a great tool for visualizing and conducting analysis of social networks. R’s igraph library provides another excellent way to manipulate and conduct analysis of social networks. On the other hand, if you have a lot of actors doing a lot of tweeting at a lot of friends, then you could end up with something like this: the Infamous “Borg Cube” that appears when you open up a file with lots of nodes and edges.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/926/1*JPc_OgX6lo7wBAZs01WF0Q.png" /><figcaption>The Infamous Gephi “Borg Cube”</figcaption></figure><p>You can, of course, run various placing, colouring and sizing algorithms to visualise something like this, but even when you do, there’s a point in which you are not going to make any sense of your network unless you can filter it in some way. But what way?</p><p>We predict that our future users — historians and the colleagues who support them — are interested in seeing a basic map that shows what happened at a particular time in a particular area of social activity. We also predict that they are going to be less interested in playing colour by numbers or moulding digital plasticine into something that (sort of) makes sense to them. We would like to produce graphs that offer a fair representation of their field of study right away with little fuss.</p><p>That should be easy right?</p><p>Basically, all you have to do is highlight those actors that have the most influence in the network. We all know that Donald Trump’s tweets are more important to the political arena than (say) a grocery store clerk. All you need to do is remove the grocery store clerks from the graph and you have a fair representation, right?</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/484/1*AjmOdY_KfHZfZ-lC61GDNg.png" /><figcaption>The Complete Network Graph</figcaption></figure><p>Well — wrong. Let me illustrate. Take the graph on the left. The current ranking of the actors are (respectively) first, E (6 connections), second, C (3), third D, B &amp; A (2 each) and forth F,G,H,I &amp; K (1 each).</p><p>Now let’s use a basic filter, removing all the nodes with degree 1. “Degree” measures the total number of edges (“sticks”) for each node (“ball”). The new ranking for the filtered graph is C (3), A, B &amp; D (2) and E (1).</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/348/1*lXtq1JI9Icx1DQX9NX8cmw.png" /><figcaption>Graph Filtered Using Degree (remove &lt;2)</figcaption></figure><p>The filtered graph is not a fair representation of the old graph. The basic problem you have with social network graphs is that the data points are dependent on each other. E’s influence depends on its connections to nodes F, G, H, I &amp; K.</p><p>The situation gets worse if you try another method, betweenness. Betweenness calculates the number of times a “walk” from one side of the graph to the other passes through a particular node. For this graph, the “walk” only passes through three nodes E, D &amp; C, so the new graph looks like this:</p><p>Also not a very helpful visualization if the goal is to show what happened in the original graph.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/260/1*LL6ZhMtpLQkv6AcY2dp7sw.png" /><figcaption>Using Betweenness as a filter.</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/414/1*1trJyAi69H3eEBiR3M9KnA.png" /><figcaption>Using closeness as a filter</figcaption></figure><p>And one more. The graph on the right is filtered using the nodes with the lowest <em>closeness</em> centrality. Closeness measures how “near” a node is to all the other nodes in the graph. In this case, we preserve the rank of E, while A &amp; B are removed and C has the same ranking as F, G, H, I &amp; K.</p><p>So which version of a filtered graph do we want to produce? Which one counts as the “best” facsimile of the original graph and how can we measure that? What gives me the right to suggest that E’s numerous connections matters more than the more cohesive connections among A, B &amp; C? This problem will expound if we include the idea of direction in a graph. Is it more important to show someone who receives a lot of emails or someone who is super-busy writing emails en masse to colleagues?</p><p>In this case, it may not matter much because we can say “well, let’s look at all the measures and then see all the iterations in context.” This is a valuable approach, because there is mound of theory about the nature of <a href="https://sociology.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/the_strength_of_weak_ties_and_exch_w-gans.pdf">weak and strong ties</a>. Sometimes the differences in centrality tell us things about the overall structure of the social graph. However, with large graphs it may be difficult or indeed impossible to show these dynamics in multiple ways. We certainly can show different graphs filtered different ways, but we cannot come up with explanations about why they differ, unless we conduct some form of meta-analysis.</p><p>That’s why I created a <a href="https://github.com/archivesunleashed/borg-reducer">borg-reducer</a> program to filter a percentage out of a network graph using a variety of methods an attractive default output for use in Gephi or <a href="http://sigmajs.org/">Sigma.js</a>. At this stage, the product simply produces the graphs. The next stage will be to produce reports that provide a meta-analysis that compares each method to the original graph and advises on which one does the best job of preserving the original structure.</p><p>While the original graph will always be there for historians to dig down and analyse for their own purposes, it is my hope that the Borg-reducer will offer attractive and appropriate “first glances” of our web archives collections, giving historians a reasonable clue about what the websites are about. Then the historian can explore in more detail using whatever method she pleases on a path that is not a digital wild goose chase.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=a8d777a7748a" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://news.archivesunleashed.org/the-perils-of-filtering-network-graphs-a8d777a7748a">The Perils of Filtering Network Graphs</a> was originally published in <a href="https://news.archivesunleashed.org">Archives Unleashed</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Led by Ian Milligan, Nick Ruest, and Jimmy Lin and supported by a grant from the <a href="https://mellon.org">Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</a>, the Archives Unleashed project will:</p><ul><li>Develop and build an open-source toolkit;</li><li>Deploy the Archives Unleashed Cloud as a one-stop portal for analysis; and</li><li>Organize datathons to provide hand-on learning opportunities to work with web archives at scale and develop a sustainable user community.</li></ul><p>In developing web archives search and data analysis tools, the <a href="https://github.com/archivesunleashed/aut">Archives Unleashed Toolkit</a> enables researchers, librarians, and archivists to access, share, and investigate recent history since the early days of the World Wide Web. We are also developing an <a href="https://github.com/archivesunleashed/auk">Archives Unleashed Cloud</a>, or AUK, that will provide a GUI front-end to work with the Toolkit. In addition, the team has developed <a href="http://archivesunleashed.org/warclight/">Warclight</a>, a<a href="http://projectblacklight.org/"> Project Blacklight</a> based<a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html"> Rails engine</a>, which supports the discovery of web archives held in the WARC and ARC formats.</p><p>AUT has a long history and builds upon efforts within the web archiving community:</p><ul><li><strong>Warcbase</strong> — Since 2013, we have been developing Warcbase, an open-source web archiving platform that takes advantage of modern big data analytics infrastructure (Hadoop, Spark, and HBase) to provide humanities scholars and social scientists access to scalable analytics over web archives. In 2017, Warcbase became the Archives Unleashed Toolkit or AUT.</li><li><strong>Web Archives for Longitudinal Knowledge (WALK) </strong>— The WALK project has seen our team working with Compute Canada (Canada’s federal computing federation) to co-locate Canadian Archive-It collections, process them using Warcbase, and ultimately index them and provide public access. This has given us experience with both working with WARCs at scale, as well as with collecting institutions via Memoranda of Interest. We are proposing to greatly expand the scope of WALK and to streamline analyses by giving organizations the power of AUT via a cloud-based portal.</li><li><strong>Archives Unleashed Datathons</strong> — a series of <a href="http://archivesunleashed.com/">Archives Unleashed datathons</a> were run by an interdisciplinary team to bring together social scientists, humanists, librarians, and computer scientists to explore web archival collections and consider them as research objects. This experience speaks to our ability to form a user community, and we propose to organize a similar series of Archives Unleashed events to help raise awareness around the tool that we are developing</li></ul><p>In just six short months, the project has made incredible head-way. Let’s take a look at the progress made!</p><h3>2017 Recap with Archives Unleashed</h3><p><strong>Formation of Archives Unleashed Team</strong></p><p>Over the past year, a group of individuals assembled to create what we know as the <a href="http://archivesunleashed.org/about-project/#project-team">Archives Unleashed Team</a>. Combining their professional backgrounds in history, library and information, and computer science, this team is passionate about pursuing possibilities and developments within the web archiving community.</p><p>The Archives Unleashed Team:</p><ul><li>Ian Milligan | Primary Investigator</li><li>Nick Ruest | Co-Investigator</li><li>Jimmy Lin | Co-Investigator</li><li>Ryan Deschamps | Postdoctoral Fellow</li><li>Samantha Fritz | Project Manager</li></ul><p><strong>Updated documentation</strong></p><p>The Archives Unleashed team has been hard at work not only in development and testing, but also to provide documentation on how to configure and use the toolkit.</p><p>We believe that this toolkit should be accessible by all, no matter their technical experience, which is why there has been a focus on documentation. It not only provides users with a step-by-step roadmap, but has also helped the team to improve functionality and provide solutions to unique instances.</p><p>Many thanks to all of our incredible users, testers, and documentors! If you would like to be involved in testing or helping to update documentation, connect with us!</p><p><strong>Codebase Development</strong></p><p>In working towards a 1.0 release of AUT, we have incorporated user feedback to improve the existing Warcbase infrastructure and to ensure the long-term sustainability of the code. We’ve left behind the Apache HBase and Wayback functionality, focusing instead on the Apache Spark-based open-source platform for analyzing web archives. <em>Fun #AUTFact, since we left HBase behind, Warcbase increasingly didn’t make sense as a name. It really is a toolkit to open up web archives for scholars, hence the “Archives Unleashed Toolkit”.</em></p><p>Additional codebase developments include support for the most recent versions of Java, Apache Spark, and other software including data output formats.</p><p>For further reading on Warcbase and the Archives Unleashed Toolkit, check out our post on the subject: “<a href="https://news.archivesunleashed.org/the-archives-unleashed-project-warcbase-is-dead-long-live-the-toolkit-724ae171c72c"><strong><em>The Archives Unleashed Project: Warcbase is dead, long live the Toolkit</em></strong></a><strong><em>.”</em></strong></p><p><strong>Adding PySpark Support</strong></p><p>Our team and the community have also made progress in adding PySpark (Python) support to the toolkit. This presents two main advantages for us. First, scholars tend to know Python more than Scala, and we are able to speak to the growing numbers of digital humanists and computational social scientists who use Python. Secondly, it lets us tap into the broad ecosystem of packages, tools, etc. that exist around Python.</p><p>For our users that prefer Scala, not to fear! The team will be maintaining both language bases, but in adopting Python we can help make the toolkit more accessible to new users.</p><p><strong>Advisory Board Meeting</strong></p><p>The project is fortunate to have an interdisciplinary group of individuals as <a href="http://archivesunleashed.org/about-project/#advisory-board">advisory board</a> members from the world of libraries, archives, social science, and computer science. The diverse range of expertise, perspectives, and advice each individual offers is invaluable to informing the project.</p><p>The advisory board met in December 2017 to discuss project progress, short and long term development, and viewed a live demo of <a href="http://archivesunleashed.org/warclight/">Warclight</a>.</p><p><strong>Datathon Planning</strong></p><p>One of the project’s mandates is to foster a community of web archiving practitioners and provide opportunities for training and collaborative hands-on experience with AUT and web archives at scale. The Archives Unleashed Team will be hosting four datathon events over the coming two years across North America.</p><p>We are looking forward to hosting our first datathon at the University of Toronto’s Robarts Library. Planning is well underway, and we look forward to seeing your <a href="http://archivesunleashed.org/toronto/">submission</a>.</p><p>For the latest news and project updates subscribe to our <a href="http://archivesunleashed.org/subscribe/">quarterly newsletter</a>.</p><p>Keeping in touch with the Archives Unleashed Project is so easy!</p><ul><li>Follow us on<a href="https://twitter.com/unleasharchives"> Twitter</a></li><li>Join our<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScXPIH0Ssw63yWqyMkUqHVYmz2-ItBMzHiJQ-sOlJwTA8u5AQ/viewform"> Slack</a> group</li><li>Participate on<a href="https://github.com/archivesunleashed"> Github</a></li></ul><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=c07adc2f9dae" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://news.archivesunleashed.org/archives-unleashed-project-2017-progress-report-c07adc2f9dae">Archives Unleashed Project: 2017 Progress Report</a> was originally published in <a href="https://news.archivesunleashed.org">Archives Unleashed</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, while browsing Twitter, I saw a few machine learning researchers post about an incident at one of their big conferences (NIPS) in which a band performing at the closing party made jokes about sexual assault. This is a band that is composed mostly of famous academics in machine learning and statistics. I was completely unsurprised to learn that a person involved in making the troubling comments is a well-respected academic who is widely known to behave inappropriately at conferences.</p><p>Right before I ever attended my first conference, one of the women who was a year ahead of me in my program pulled me aside to warn about him. She told me to do my best to avoid him at the conference but “every woman has a story about him, so it’s only a matter of time.” Of course, she was right. Months before my defense, while at a poster session to present my dissertation work, he touched me on the leg and told me that my dress was “way too sexy for a poster session.” I remember feeling deflated.</p><p>In the years since, he’s sent me several inappropriate private Facebook messages. In the first, he responded to a Facebook post I had made asking for people’s experiences with Lasik eye surgery with a message that some activities would become much better. Trying to deflect what I thought was going to be an awkward interaction, I responded that I was looking forward to better bird watching. He followed up with a private message that “the activity [he was] thinking about was sex, but bird watching would be better too ;)”. I ignored him. On another occasion, I posted about some data visualizations using data from a medical journal that involved the relationship between age and pubic hair. He sent me a private message explaining how the data is corroborated by his own experiences watching a certain genre of porn. What his personal preferences regarding porn are is something I definitely did not want to know. Perhaps I shouldn’t have posted about the data given the racy topic, but I thought it was in-bounds since it was a comment on data in a medical journal. I guess I was wrong. I responded but tried to end the conversation quickly. On another occasion, he sent me a private message out of the blue to let me know that there was another researcher with a name very similar to my own who published an article that “is even about sex, broadly defined (fecundity). You guys related?”</p><p>The thing is, he’s not even the worst in our field. At ISBA 2010 (the same conference where the comments were made about my dress), I saw and experienced things that, in retrospect, were instrumental in my decision to (mostly) leave the field. In my opinion, the worst offender is S (full name left out intentionally). He spent the first half of the conference befriending my friend and me and acting interested in our research. He would occasionally say things that were questionable but would immediately follow up with pictures of his young daughters or stories to make himself out to be a doting husband and father. I now believe this was to gain our trust.</p><p>One night after the conference talks were over, a bunch of conference participants and I went for a swim in the ocean. While I was swimming around, S repeatedly grabbed me under the water, putting his hands on my torso, hips, and thighs. I tried to play it off and swim away. He picked me up and pulled me into his chest. He then started to carry me away from the rest of the group, presumably to have some sort of private moment with me that I had absolutely no interest in sharing with him. I struggled, gently at first and then more forcefully, and he let me go.</p><p>As I swam back to the group, I remember again feeling totally humiliated. I felt that this was evidence that, like S, all of the other more senior men who had showed interest in my research must actually have only been trying to sleep with me. I felt embarrassed that I had been seen being friendly with him, like everyone else was in on it and they all thought I must like this sort of attention. I felt that I had brought it on myself by actively participating in the conference culture that rewarded provocative comments and excessive drunkenness with social approval and acceptance into an old boys club of sorts. I felt like a joke, and I carried this feeling with me for years after.</p><p>I was not the only person who was bothered by S’s behavior. He relentlessly pressured my friend, a female graduate student, to have sex with him by saying that because he was married and she was engaged, those two things “cancelled each other out”. Therefore, he argued, they should have sex.</p><p>At this same conference, the morning after a particularly debaucherous night, a married professor was overheard imploring other people to smell his fingers following an encounter with a junior colleague. With the benefit of hindsight, I now recognize my experience at that conference as a critical moment in my career, one I looked back on shortly thereafter when I decided that perhaps this version of academia was not for me.</p><p>At JSM (another stats conference) a few years later at the Google reception, S was standing right behind me talking loudly about “banging smokin’ hot chicks.” I turned around to give him a look that I hoped would tell him to knock it off but he replied that I was just jealous that he wasn’t talking about me. The group he was standing with laughed, and I felt disgusted that he actually thought that I’d liked how he’d groped me at the conference years before.</p><p>I debated saying something about him at the time, but who would have cared? It was a story passed down among female graduate students in my circles that when one woman graduate student was groped at a party by a professor and reported it to a senior female professor, she was told that if she wanted to stay in the field, she’d just have to get used to it. On many occasions, I have been smacked on the butt at conferences. No one ever seemed to think it was a problem. I knew it would be even more difficult to get people to find S’s behavior problematic since he is employed by a large tech company and his participation in academic conferences, I have heard, often comes with sponsorship money.</p><p>About two years ago, there was a turning point that made me decide to start speaking up about what I’d experienced in statistics. I made it a point to privately tell anyone I felt I could trust in my field about all of my experiences. Privately, I named names. I told my male friends and colleagues in the field about how these experiences had impacted my career trajectory in hopes that they would be vigilant for this type of behavior. I told women who the bad actors were, hoping they would be able to avoid them.</p><p>I started doing this because I heard that S (for the second time to my knowledge) had taken advantage of a junior person who had had too much to drink. This time, his act had been witnessed first-hand by several professors at the conference. Since then, I have heard one professor who witnessed the incident openly lament that he’ll have to find a way to delicately advise his female students on “how not to get raped by S” so as not to lose promising students.</p><p>To say that S’s bad behavior is an open secret in the community is an understatement. With the current turning of the tides in regards to how seriously sexual harassment in professional settings is taken, I’d been hoping that this behavior would stop and that those who were known to have engaged in this behavior would not be elevated to positions of prestige and authority. But, a few weeks ago I received an email announcing that S was up for election to the ISBA Board of Directors. I appealed to two incredible friends/colleagues with more senior standing in the organization (who have always taken complaints about these things very seriously), and at their urging, he was removed from the ballot. This makes me hopeful that change is coming.</p><p>However, the fact that he even made the ballot, combined with hearing that jokes about sexual assault are brazenly being made by a person we all know to be one of the harassers is the second turning point for me. It’s clear change isn’t coming fast enough. I don’t want to only speak quietly behind the scenes, hoping that someone with more academic clout than I have will do something about it. While comments alone certainly do not rise to the level of assault, they normalize the hostile atmosphere, particularly for women, in the field. The fact that people are comfortable publicly making jokes about sexual assault on stage at a conference reveals how toxic the environment remains.</p><p>We need to start holding prominent individuals accountable for how their inappropriate behavior negatively impacts the careers of their junior colleagues. I’m saying this publicly because whenever I have shared these stories privately with my colleagues, both men and women, they are appalled. It is time for us to be publicly and openly appalled, not just attempting to tactfully deflect inappropriate advances and privately warning other women. We need to remove the power of the “open secret” that these people use to take advantage of their respected positions in our field. We know who these people are, and we should stop tolerating this culture of harassment, or else we become complicit in it.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=304638dc5de5" width="1" height="1">]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have seen evidence that websites gathering support for both the “Yes” and “No” side of the Quebec referendum existed in October 1995, but I cannot prove it.</p><p>They probably looked something like <a href="http://www.chebucto.ns.ca/Current/HalifaxSummitG7/">this website for the G7 Summit in Halifax in the same year</a>.</p><p>Unless someone has them hiding somewhere on an Intel 486 computer somewhere in their basement, both of these important documents in Canada’s history are lost for good.</p><p>Unfortunately, it was not clear to people in 1995 that web pages were historical documents that people might want to use for research in 2017, 2067 or 2117. Nor were the tools really available to preserve websites into the future. While the tools for preservation are somewhat better in 2017, we still have a number of tough choices to make because of finite resources.</p><p>The good news is that the librarians and researchers that take this problem seriously, are getting some institutional support. The <a href="http://www.carl-abrc.ca/">Canadian Association of Research Libraries (CARL)</a> has decided to formalize some already great work being done around the country to help preserve our digital Canadian heritage. With the <a href="http://www.carl-abrc.ca/mini-site-page/cwac-inaugural-meeting/">inaugural meeting of Canadian Web Archiving Coalition (CWAC) in September 2017,</a> I was able to see some important people in the field discuss some of the many challenges of preservation. While I do not want to go into specifics before documents have been passed around and discussed, I would like to relay some of the themes I found.</p><h3>Web Archiving Needs Institutionalization and Resources</h3><p>The reality is that while the curation, storage, and preservation of websites has great support in the <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> and their many <a href="https://archive-it.org/">services</a>, web archives tends to be done on the side of the desk by research librarians with many other competing responsibilities and few dedicated full-time staff. As such, it is difficult for the people responsible to develop expertise in preserving web records properly. While Archive-It does much of the heavy work for making crawls, it still takes a good understanding of the collection process to make it work. Like in the movie <a href="http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/99382%7C90494/Desk-Set.html">Desk Set</a>, where librarian Bunny Watson (played by Katherine Hepburn) proves to the innovative computer engineer, Richard Sumner (played by Spencer Tracy) that her team cannot be replaced by a computer, the quality and relevance of collections still needs a human touch. (Incidentally, the story of Agnes Law for whom the character Bunny Watson was based is an under-told gem of computer history).</p><h3>Libraries are Constrained by Fear of Legal Risk</h3><p>While copyright policy is not a bad thing, fear of breaching copyright is an important concern of many librarians building a web archive collection. I had the impression that fear of potential lawsuits overrode service, which is a hard area to tread. My understanding is that fair dealing covers a good amount of research in web archives, particular when research involves the use of derivatives from the archives rather than the entire archive itself.</p><p>However, in some cases, the legal risk is very high and therefore the fear is understandable. In other cases, it seemed like the risk was very low and I wondered whether it was a good thing to have lawyers determine service standards this way. More importantly, legal uncertainty is definitely hurting libraries’ ability to provide open access to web archives, increasing costs and limiting their ability to be comprehensive.</p><p>The solutions, of course, are to focus on public domain, open licensed or materials whose permissions are easily obtained. However, there are probably some unrealized opportunities to apply fair dealing principles for expanding access to these collections. For example, I imagine that <a href="https://dataverse.scholarsportal.info/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=hdl:10864/11301">derivatives from web archives like </a>extraction of links for network graphs or metadata from multiple collections could be used to better effect. This means taking calculated risks however and that can be more than what many small academic institutions can bear.</p><h3>Researchers are not clear on what they want to study</h3><p>As someone fairly new to web archives, it’s not really clear what research questions I would want to ask that relate to web archives. Based on what I’ve seen in the literature so far, the answer is “nothing at all.” As a researcher looking to write articles with clear theses on understandable topics, coping with the size and complexity of Web Archive data is too onerous, when I could just rely on traditional sources like news articles to tell the story. This works for the independent researcher, but at a societal level it is a disaster. Multiple first-hand accounts of the sort found in many blogs coming from a variety of sources is an essential tool for confirming and evaluating historical information. Given the convergence of media organizations across the globe, all researchers relying on media to conduct modern history is not the path to a comprehensive picture of the 21st Century.</p><p>On the other hand, when <a href="https://medium.com/u/3a79ecb7b5df">Ian Milligan</a> tells me to play with derivatives from web archives, it’s not entirely clear what kinds of questions I should be asking of 30+ terabytes worth of Web Archives. At this stage, the learning I am doing has much more to do with <a href="https://spark.apache.org">Apache spark</a>, <a href="https://www.ssh.com/ssh/protocol/">ssh</a>, computational analysis and managing the dependencies of whatever software library I plan to use. Teaching others about this stuff on their various different computers with different operating systems, .bash_profiles and setups often means you spend the entire day getting started, rather than learning about the web archives themselves. Getting to the meat of questions like “What was the Canadian Internet like in 2002 and why?” seem far off to me, and I have intermediate-to-advanced programming skills. I have experimented with <a href="https://greebie.github.io/aut-client/">some exploratory visualizations</a> and these are a start, but I look forward to the time when we see citations of web archives in peer reviewed research without fanfare.</p><h3>Libraries are not clear on what they want to prioritize.</h3><p>As I said before, libraries are very aware of the challenges and importance of preserving Canada’s digital record. Someone gets charged with making web archives happen; they receive a budget to “pilot” an Archive-It account; they pick something to play with, which may or may not have specific relevance to their institution. Often they start with institutional records like the university’s website or local government websites. Other web archives focus on <a href="http://www.greylit.org/about">grey literature</a> in a research area important to their institution. Nonetheless, there is recognition for increased collaboration across institutions to help build standards for the scope, relevance and quality of web archive collection development.</p><p>Collaboration was a key theme at the meeting, with special attention to the unsymmetrical distribution of resources available to different academic institutions. No one suggested that the asymmetry was a problem per se, but did feel that it required strategies to coordinate access to web archives across the board. In general, the group was thankful for the participation and support from existing web archives, but more communication and participation is required.</p><h3>The Issue Goes Beyond the Academy</h3><p>Public libraries are always seen by the academic libraries as an essential part of the picture for any archival activities — especially those placed online because these are publicly accessible records of course! However, for all the challenges that small academic institutions face, public libraries face them tenfold. Based on experience and brief discussion with public librarians, this is not due to lack of interest, but primarily lack of resources. In public libraries, there is so much to do to engage the public with knowledge that preservation sits way back. Local history and genealogy projects are already taxed — adding the skills and expertise is just one more facet to worry about. Fortunately, the Internet Archive has <a href="https://archive.org/scanning"><strong>the Building Libraries Together project</strong></a><strong> </strong>to help build capacity for public libraries to engage more digital materials.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>While there is plenty more to say about the meeting, I think I can leave it to others to add to the conversation. Also, the meeting was merely a start of the conversation about what’s going on with Web Archives.</p><p>In sum, it is very promising that web archives are now on the agenda at CARL. I look forward to reading more about what the plans are and I hope to be able to contribute what I can to help anyone improve on their collections process.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=83872b114fb3" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://news.archivesunleashed.org/the-future-of-web-archives-in-canada-the-inaugural-meeting-of-the-canadian-web-archives-coalition-83872b114fb3">The Future of Web Archives in Canada: The Inaugural Meeting of the Canadian Web Archives Coalition</a> was originally published in <a href="https://news.archivesunleashed.org">Archives Unleashed</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>
